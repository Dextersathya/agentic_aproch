🧠 Multi-LLM Agentic Flow with Ollama, LangChain, and LangGraph
This project demonstrates a collaborative multi-agent AI architecture where multiple LLMs interact using a LangGraph-based flow, powered by LangChain and Ollama. It simulates how agents can collaborate, build memory, receive feedback, and stream responses.

🚀 Features
✅ Dual LLMs communicate and refine answers
✅ LangGraph controls the agentic workflow
✅ ReAct-style reasoning & action system (ReAct architecture)
✅ Memory-enhanced version with contextual continuity
✅ Human feedback integration (Reward Model Ready)
✅ Streaming responses for better interactivity
✅ Visualization of graph flow
✅ Modular design: ready for advanced task planning, tool use, and sub-agent expansion

📦 Requirements
bash
Copy
Edit
pip install langchain langgraph ollama pillow
Ensure Ollama is installed and running:

bash
Copy
Edit

🔄 ReAct Agent Architecture (Reason + Act)
This project supports ReAct-style architecture, where:

Agents reason about the query

They may take intermediate actions

Output is formed in a step-by-step reasoning process

Model 1 acts as the reasoner
Model 2 plays the refiner / act executor role

This is similar to:

Thought → Action → Observation → Thought → Final Answer
🧠 Adding Memory in Agentic Graph
The ConversationalMultiLLMAgent class:

Stores and reuses previous questions & answers.

Maintains short-term memory (last 2 exchanges).

Dynamically incorporates historical context into current prompts.

📌 Code available inside: ConversationalMultiLLMAgent in multi_llm_agent.py

👂 Human Feedback Integration
This project is ready for human-in-the-loop feedback:

Each output can be manually rated and logged.

Feedback mechanisms (e.g., thumbs up/down or reward score) can be added.

This can train a reward model or adjust future prompts.

You can extend the code to log:

python
Copy
Edit
{
    "query": ...,
    "model1_output": ...,
    "model2_output": ...,
    "final_result": ...,
    "feedback_score": ...  # manually or automatically added
}
🌊 Streaming Support (Experimental)
LangChain + Ollama supports streaming via generator interfaces.
This repo can be extended for:

Token-by-token generation

Real-time user interface (Streamlit / Terminal)

📌 Feature placeholder included for streaming extensions.

💬 Example Use
python
Copy
Edit
from multi_llm_agent import MultiLLMAgent

agent = MultiLLMAgent()
result = agent.process_sync("Explain quantum computing")

print(result['final_result'])
With Memory:
python
Copy
Edit
from multi_llm_agent import ConversationalMultiLLMAgent

agent = ConversationalMultiLLMAgent()
result = asyncio.run(agent.process_with_memory("What is machine learning?"))
📊 Graph Diagram
When you run the script, a PNG workflow diagram is saved as:

START → MODEL1 → MODEL2 → END
🔧 Extendable Ideas
Add tools (e.g., calculator, search API) to agents

Add task decomposition with more sub-agents

Turn it into an agent framework for autonomous workflows

Integrate feedback-based fine-tuning (RLHF)

✅ Run Demo
bash
Copy
Edit
python multi_llm_agent.py
This runs:

Static agent tests (MultiLLMAgent)

Conversational memory agent test (ConversationalMultiLLMAgent)
